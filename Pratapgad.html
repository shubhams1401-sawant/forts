		<p class="forts_details">  
		Pratapgad literally 'Valour Fort' is a large mountain fort located in Satara district, in the Western Indian state of Maharashtra. The fort's historical significance is due to the Battle of Pratapgad in 1659. The fort is now a popular tourist destination.</p>
		<p>Pratapgad Fort is a mountain fort built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The fort is at a distance of 24 km from the hill station of Mahabaleshwar. The fort holds a sturdy view of coastal Konkan. The Bhavani Temple and Afzal Khan's tomb are other places of interest.The famous minister Morepant Pingale on the command of Shivaji Maharaj to control the rebellious satraps of the surrounding Javali Basin built Pratapgad Fort in 1656. It is believed that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaja was blessed with a shining sword at the temple of Goddess Bhavani here. The historic battle between Chhatrapati Shivaji and Afzal Khan, the commander of the Bijapur Sultanate took place at Pratapgad. </p><br>
		<h3>Geography:-</h3>
		<p>Pratapgad fort is located 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Poladpur and 23 kilometres (14 mi) west of Mahabaleshwar, a popular hill station in the area. The fort stands 1,080 metres (3,540 ft) above sea level and is built on a spur which overlooks the road between the villages of Par and Kinesvar.</p><br>
		<h3>History:-</h3>
		<p>The Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj commissioned Moropant Trimbak Pingle, his prime minister, to undertake the construction of this fort in order to defend the banks of the Nira and the Koyna rivers, and to defend the Par pass.
		
		It was completed in 1656.</p><p> The Battle of Pratapgad between Shivaji and Afzal Khan was fought below the ramparts of this fort on 10 November 1659. This was the first major test of the fledgling kingdom's army, and set the stage of the establishment of the Maratha empire. Pratapgad continued to be involved in regional politics. Sakharam Bapu, a well-known minister of Pune, was confined by his rival Nana Phadnis in Pratapgad in 1778. He was later moved from fort to fort until he died at Raigad. In 1796, Nana Phadnis, while escaping from the intrigues of Daulatrao Shinde and his minister Baloba, assembled a strong garrison in Pratapgad before heading to Mahad. In 1818, as part of the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Pratapgad surrendered by private negotiation. This was a great loss to the Maratha forces, as Pratapgad was an important stronghold, had a large garrison, and could suppress much of the country around Wai. A 17 feet high equestrian bronze statue of Shivaji was unveiled by Jawaharlal Nehru, then Prime Minister of India, on 30 November 1957, the same year a road was constructed by the Public Works Department from Kumbhrosi village up to fort.[citation needed] A guest house and a national park were built inside the fort in 1960.[citation needed] The fort is currently owned by Udayanraje Bhosale, the heir to the former Satara princely state.
