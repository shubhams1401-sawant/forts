		<h1>RAJGAD</h1>

		<p class="forts_details">  
		Rajgad (literal meaning Ruling Fort) is a hill fort situated in the Pune district of Maharashtra, India. Formerly known as Murumdev, the fort was the capital of the Maratha Empire under the rule of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj for almost 26 years, after which the capital was moved to the Raigad Fort.[1] Treasures discovered from an adjacent fort called Torna were used to completely build and fortify the Rajgad Fort.</p>
		<p>The Rajgad Fort is located around 60 km (37 mi) to the south-west of Pune and about 15 km (9.3 mi) west of Nasrapur in the Sahyadris range. The fort lies 1,376 m (4,514 ft) above the sea level. The diameter of the base of the fort was about 40 km (25 mi) which made it difficult to lay siege on it, which added to its strategic value. The fort's ruins consist of palaces, water cisterns, and caves. This fort was built on a hill called Murumbadevi Dongar (Mountain of the Goddess Murumba). Rajgad boasts of the highest number of days stayed by Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on any fort.</p><br>
		<h3>History:-</h3>
		<p>Shivaji Maharaj also built fort Lingana near the Raigad Fort after capturing it. In 1689, Zulfikhar Khan captured Raigad and Aurangzeb renamed it as Islamgad. After this, the fort fell under Siddi Fathekan till 1733. In 1765, the fort became the target of the armed expedition by the British East India company. Finally, on 9 May 1818, it came under the rule of Britishers.</p>
		<p>This spectacular fort was built by Chandrarao Mores in 1030. It was known as the fort of Rairi and was seized by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in 1656 from the royal house of Chandrarao Mores, a junior or Cadet dynasty from the ancient Maurya Dynasty. The last More King was the feudatory of the Sultan of Bijapur. Shivaji renovated and expanded the fort of Rairi and then renamed it as Raigad which means the King's Fort. It was also considered as the capital of the Maratha kingdom.</p>
		<p>The fort has stood witness to many significant historic events including the birth of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's son Rajaram I, the death of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Queen Saibai, the return of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj from Agra, the burial of Afzal Khan's head in the Mahadarwaja walls of Balle Killa, the strict words of Sonopant Dabir to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.</p>
		<p>The Rajgad Fort was also one of the 12 forts that Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj kept when he signed the Treaty of Purandar in 1665, with the Mughal general Jai Singh I, leader of the Mughal forces. Under this treaty, 23 forts were handed over to the Mughals.</p><br>
		<h3>Tourism:-</h3>
		<p>The fort is a significant tourist destination and is most sought after especially during monsoon. Visitors prefer to stay overnight on the fort considering the fort itself is huge and cannot be explored in a single day. The Padmavati temple on the fort can accommodate around 50 people. Water tanks provide fresh water all throughout the year. Villagers from the foothills of Rajgad sell local antiques and items to these tourists.</p><br>
		<h3>How to reach:-</h3>
		<p>The Rajgad Fort is located around 60 km (37 mi) to the south-west of Pune and about 15 km (9.3 mi) west of Nasrapur in the Sahyadris range. The fort lies 1,400 m (4,600 ft) above the sea level. The diameter of the base of the fort was about 40 km (25 mi) which made it difficult to lay siege on it, which added to its strategic value.</p><br>
		<h3>Best timing to visit:-</h3>
		<p>The ideal time to visit the Raigad fort is during November to March as winters are not harsh here. The weather remains pleasant, and you will enjoy trekking or ropeway the most during winters. Summers are hot in Raigad as the mercury reaches up to 50 degrees Celsius. Therefore, March to June is generally avoided by tourists.</p><br>
